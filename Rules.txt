Welcome to bots!

This is the Kernalization discord server bots repository. Every user on the
team has a separate folder where they can edit, push, pull, and do anything 
else they'd like. For right now, we're running on the honor's system. The 
rules are simple and pretty straightforward. 

RULES:

1) Read the rules in the bots.doc/bots.odt files. This is the proposal 
documentation, and is located in the root bots.git folder, so everyone has 
access to it. 

2) This is important: do not mess with anyone else's files without their 
permission. This is where the honor's system comes in to play. I can view
every change to every file in every directory. If a user complains that 
you changed/deleted/did anything else to their files, I can see where you did
it. If you want to pull their directory and make modifications, go for it!
That's in the spirit of the project. Anybody can collaborate and modify 
other's code. BUT. If you do, add it to your own directory, don't overwrite 
theirs. Accidents happen, but I can tell when something malicious was done.

3) Another honor's system key: give credit where credit is due! It can be 
frustrating when people rip off your work, and is incredibly unethical. If 
you modify someone else's work, give them credit somewhere in the 
documentation.

4) Common sense. I shouldn't have to list out every conceivable rule that 
governs this project. You guys are intelligent (for the most part ;) ) so 
just use your best knowledge. 



Moderating **should** be light. This is a creative community. Make cool stuff,
don't break other's cool stuff, and improve your own knowledge. 

Bot away all day!
